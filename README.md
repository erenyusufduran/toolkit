# Toolkit

This project is about preparing modules, but also includes small projects related to using these modules. If you want to examine / run it locally, move the folder names `usage-of-toolkit` to a another folder. Afterwards, add the folder with the remaining files into the `usage-of-toolkit`. This way, you will be able to operate it without any problems.

A simple example how to create a reusable Go module with commonly used tools.

The included Tools are:

- Get a random string of length n
- Upload a file to a specified directory
- Create a directory, including all parent directories, if it does not already exist
